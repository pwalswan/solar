incomplete

Using Visual Studio Code for development
Created folder called solar and added a data directory with exercise data files
Download Docker Desktop for Mac Intel, choose default complete installation (added Docker to path for terminal commands)
Installed VSCode Python extension
My python3 --version is 3.8.5
Create virtual environment name venv 
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

That created a venv in the project root with bin, lib and include

Installed VSCode Docker extension and let it generate default Python Dockerfile
My app entrypoint is solar.py (print("Executing"))

docker build -t solar-image .
docker run --name solar-irradiance solar-image (it runs and exits)

... and how you approached the problem
1. Found definitions for the technical terms

I have the photon counts. Need to put that into an equation. I need to calculate the irradiance in Watts/m2/nm for UpScan and DownScan and compare results.
I also later need to add the temperature correction using data in detectorTemp.txt
I also later need to adjust for the grating offset using the data in referenceSpectrum.txt
I need to plot the data for the a and b cases.
I need a summary.

I need to load data. I'm using pandas instead of plain python since pandas has dataframe features and can later be plotted.
pip3 install pandas
This adds pandas, etc. to site-packages

Starting with plans since it includes the start and end times for the UpScan and DownScan periods
The integrationTime file appears to be the measurement period. It starts off at once per second and varies thereafter.
